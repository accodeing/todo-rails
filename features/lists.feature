  As a user

    Then I navigate to the new list page

  Scenario Outline:
  Create new list

    Given I am on the new list page
    When I enter the title "<Title>"
    And I enter the description "<Description>"
    And I create a new list
    Then a new list is <maybe> created
    And the page contains "<Title>"
    And the page contains "<Description>"
